# SpaceInvadersV-in-C

Tom wrote the CConsole library.
used it to write a craZy SpaceInvaders using C

To initialize Game:
* Open with Windows Console in terminal (not usual powershell terminal - microsoft likes its compiler to only run on a windows terminal)
* Open VSCode in Windows Console
* Build the project with ctrl-shift-b
* Run in terminal or VSCode

This version of SpaceInvaders is very funny!!!
It works with 1 line of aliens being shot by 1 player.

Controls:
* Player left = A
* Player right = D
* Shoot = spacebar

You can adjust the speed of player, alien and bullet easily in the code - speed it up and it gets super crazy!

There are still options to add to this game but being a console C game it's not it's ideal thing, but still fun to code.

Enjoy!
